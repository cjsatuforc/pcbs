Welcome to the UTAT Space Systems PCB documentation
===================================================

Space Systems is a division of the University of Toronto Aerospace Team creating a 3U cubesatellite, HERON MkII. Our primary mission objective is to study the real-time gene expression of C. Albicans in response to a microgravity environment. Our hypothesis is that C. Albicans, a type of yeast found in the huamn gut flora, would have heightened virulent gene expression in response to microgravity.

The purpose of the PCBs repository is to create version control for the Altium projects which contain our PCB hardware design. The purpose of this documentation is to give new and existing members a source of information on creating and structuring Altium PCB projects. It covers the following topics:

- :ref:`getting-started`
- :ref:`project-setup`
- :ref:`schematic-layout`
- :ref:`compilation`
- :ref:`pcb-layout`
- :ref:`project-outputs`
